# Rulings

The decider's record, and its only memory. Every session of `/decide` starts by
reading this file whole and ends by committing to it.

The implementer raises questions (`SPEC-QUESTIONS.md`), records the choices the
specification did not make (`DECISIONS-OUTSIDE-SPEC.md`), proposes promotions
(`PROMOTIONS.md`) and asks for review (`REVIEW-REQUEST.md`). This file is where
those are answered. A ruling here binds the implementer as `docs/` does; where it
changed `docs/`, `docs/` is the authority and the ruling is the reason.

**Identifiers** `R-NNN`, in order, never reused, never renumbered. A ruling is
reversed only by a later one that names it.

---

## State

**Register watermark:** none — no `D-NNN` has been audited yet. The next audit
starts at `D-001`. Entries already marked by the human (promoted, closed) are
ratified in bulk unless something in them no longer holds.

## Owed by the implementer

Actions a ruling requires of the code or of the plan. The implementer cites the
`R-NNN` in the commit that does it; the decider marks it done with that commit.

*None.*

## Escalated to the user

Rulings with verdict `escalated` or `pending`, until the user answers.

*None.*

### R-001 — The decider holds the human's authority over `docs/`, within reserves

**Date:** 2026-09-23   **Origin:** user
**Verdict:** resolved
**docs/:** `docs/CLAUDE.md` rewritten to name the decider. No specification text
changed.

Granted by Federico Xella on 2026-09-23, in these words: *"Vorrei che tu fossi
l'agente decisore che mi aiuta in progettazione e analisi del simulatore. Hai
quindi il permesso di scrivere e modificare `/doc`, il dovere di valutare le
decisioni prese dall'implementatore e risolverne le obiezioni e i conflitti
sollevati."*

**What it covers.** Writing and editing `docs/`; answering `SPEC-QUESTIONS.md`
entries, `REVIEW-REQUEST.md` items and `PROMOTIONS.md` candidates; auditing
`DECISIONS-OUTSIDE-SPEC.md` and ratifying, promoting or rejecting its entries;
numbering new `DEC-` and requirement identifiers. The procedure is
`.claude/skills/decide/SKILL.md`.

**Two roles, kept apart.** The same model plays both, so the independence
`AGENTS.md` protects — a specification that is not an account of its own
implementation — has to come from procedure. A decider session never writes
code, tests or `PLAN.md`; an implementer session never writes `docs/`. And a
ruling's rationale must be valid on the merits, as it would have been before the
code existed; existing code counts as cost only.

**Reserves — escalated to the user, never ruled.**

1. **The governance itself**: this entry, the decide skill, `AGENTS.md`, and the
   split between the two roles.
2. **Weakening the gates**: removing or loosening an acceptance criterion, a
   phase gate of `SIM-REQ` §18, or `NFR-01` to `NFR-04`. Tightening them is
   within the delegation.
3. **`SIM-OBS`**: adding, removing or rewriting an observable. It states what the
   game is for, and its ceiling of five is declared a decision with a cost.
4. **`SIM-REQ` §20**: the downstream constraints belong to a consumer this
   repository cannot see.
5. **Anything the user decided personally** before this delegation, recorded as
   such in `docs/` or in the files above, unless the user reopens it.

**Cost.** Questions the human used to answer are answered by a model that also
writes the code, so a class of error both roles share can pass both. The user
remains the review of the reviewer: every ruling is a commit, readable and
revertible.
**Owed by the implementer:** nothing. `AGENTS.md` now tells it where answers
come from.
**Would overturn it:** the user withdrawing or narrowing the delegation, or a
ruling found to have edited `docs/` to match the code.
**Not verified:** the workflow has not run once. The first `/decide` session is
its test.
